# cli-hangman

A simple Symfony 2 hangman game developed in the minibus on the way down to PHP SouthCoast to pass the time.

This is the revised version of Hangman that adheres to the right way to render hangman - the first version started with a fully drawn Hangman and removed the limbs as incorrect characters are guessed.
